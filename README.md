# Collection-View-in-a-collection-view-cell
An extended version of https://github.com/ashfurrow/Collection-View-in-a-Table-View-Cell 
by @ashfurrow which uses collectionView instead of a tableView to display child collectionViews

####This has some advantages :
1. You can do more customization the main collection-view-cell. e.g you can add a a title  and button to the cell
which can open a detail-view-controller.

2. Code is much more abstracted.

3. well abstacted data-source for each collection-view.

4. collection-views are added programmatically instead of in the storyboard.
